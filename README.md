# GO-fiber-gorm-API

My first GO API using the framework Fiber, ORM called GORM and using SQLite - DB connection, routes, CRUD HTTP operations, models, etc. are all present. 
Feel free to use this tiny API, I made it for learning purposes as I'm headed towards Full-stack development,
and I chose GO as the backend for that. Library air for GO was also used in order for the auto-reload of the GO code.
I recommend you download GO extensions for VS Code in case you'll be using this API along with VS Code.
I also recommend SQLite extension in case you'll be using SQLite, and Postman software for testing the whole API.
